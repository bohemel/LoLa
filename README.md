# LoLa

A super bad and super simple blog platform. Runs on my personal site 
[http://joelsoderberg.se](http://joelsoderberg.se) if you want to see it in 
action.

 * Single user
 * NO database (all data is stored in files on the filesystem)
 
## Why

I just want to get my message out! :D

I work with Drupal, and love it! But I wanted a blog and something to code 
that wasn't Drupal. So this is it.

## Plans

 * Smart posts! the engine will categorize the post into some basic 
   types (text, link, video, audio, etc.). Then rendered in a way that 
   fits the content.
 * Supercaching - serve static html-files when possible. More on this later
 * Social integration / Comments
